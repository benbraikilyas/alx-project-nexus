## Mobile-Developmen 
-----------------------------
I have a mobile development app called "My🐶Dog" for dog-related content.

 It's a recognized medical information resource powered by artificial intelligence, covering all dog breeds and their history. It will also provide information on vaccines and medications, and will connect users with the nearest dog clinics or veterinary centers, along with veterinary contact information. This app will implement everything I learned in Pro Dev FE.
